# PathoPhenoDB

PathoPhenoDB is a database of human pathogens, the
diseases and phenotypes they elicit in human organisms, and
information related to drug treatments and mechanisms of drug
resistance. Specifically, PathoPhenoDB contains associations between
pathogens and diseases, between pathogens and phenotypes, between
drugs that are approved to treat particular pathogens, and it
identifies genes or proteins within pathogens that can convey
resistance to particular drugs.
